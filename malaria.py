Description:
    This progam annotate partially a nucleotide .fna file with the protein
    description contained in a .tab blastx results generated file. By inserting the
    information contained in the column 'hitDescription' from the blastx results
    .tab file to the right end of the id-lines, separated by a tab space, in
    the .fna sequences file. It generates an output.txt file with the results.
    
List of functions:
    get_annots(annot)
    add_annots(annot, seq, out)
    
List of modules used that are not explained in the course material:
    ---
    
Procedure:
    1.- The program gets the list of annotations associating it with the file
    object f1. It skips the header line in the file when looking at the lines.
    2.- It creates an empty instance. The first and tenth coulmns from the list
    of annotations are extracted and inserted in the empty instance both
    separated by a tab space.
    3.- Then, the program gets the fasta file associating it with the file
    object f2. Additionally, it creates the an output empty file.
    4.- Iteration: The program looks for all the lines beginning with ">" in
    the fasta file. The line is splitted after the last string of text.
    5.- Each line of the annotations extracted are appended at the end of each
    id-header anteceded by a tab space. The lines are appended in the exact
    same order they are in the annotation's file.
    *.- (Here is missing the matching of the query Name in the blastx file with
    the id in the fasta file, which I could not manage. Therefore, the
    hitDescription annotated in the output file is not accurate).
    6.- Output file is generated.
    
    *.- Got inspired by: "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29930050/adding-each-item-in-list-to-end-of-specific-lines-in-fasta-file"
